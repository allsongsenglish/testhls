  # Define your site menus here (e.g., main navigation)

# By default, Hugo uses the "content" directory.
# The homepage will list content from the "movies" section.
# To make "movies" the main section for the homepage:
[permalinks]
  # movies = "/:slug/" # Example: if you want movies at /movie-slug/
  # homepage = "/" # This is usually default

# Configure the homepage to list content from the 'movies' section
# This requires that your list.html is set up to handle this.
# And your content is in content/movies/
# This is often the default behavior if 'movies' is the only top-level content directory.
# For more explicit control, you might need to adjust defaultContentLanguageInSubdir or other settings
# or create a specific layouts/index.html if list.html in _default is not sufficient.
# For now, we rely on the default list.html to pick up the 'movies' content type.
# Setting a theme is not necessary when developing a theme in the site's root like this.
# However, if you were to package this as a standalone theme, you'd set theme = "your-theme-name"
# in a separate exampleSite/hugo.toml.
# The `theme` key is commented out or removed when the theme is directly in the project's /layouts, /static, etc.
# For the purpose of this project, we assume the theme files are directly used.
# No 'theme' key needed here.

# Ensure pagination is enabled for the homepage (which uses list.html for movies)
